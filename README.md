# waterlevelmonitorandcontrolsystem
this is a mini project which i have done in my college
this project measures the level of water in over head tank and we can monitor the level of water through blynk app
and we can switch on or off the motor pump by the same blynk app
i have used the components like nodemcu(esp8266),relay module,water pump.
the website of blynk and blnk mobile app are used for controlling and monitoring the water level
